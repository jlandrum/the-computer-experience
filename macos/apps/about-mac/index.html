            This site plays homage to the classic Mac OS 9 operating system. This operating system was released in 1999 and was the last version of the classic Mac OS. It was succeeded by Mac OS X in 2001. Mac OS 9 introduced many new features, such as multiple users, voiceprint password, and voice control.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also introduced the "Platinum" interface, which was a major design overhaul from the previous "Aqua" interface.
          </p>
